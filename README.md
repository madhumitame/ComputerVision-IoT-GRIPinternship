# ComputerVision-IoT-GRIPinternship
#These are the tasks performed through the GRIP internship by The Sparks Foundation

The first folder contains all the files related to Object detection using Single Shot Detector - mobilenet_v3, using the coco dataset for identification of objects. Make sure to download all of the files in same folder before proceeding to run the python program. This program can identify 80 different classes of objects and adjusting the threshold can help with the accuracy.

The second folder contains the program for identifying colours in a video in real time. The folder contains a python file of the program code and a screenshot of the output that i got using the cover of my notebook.
